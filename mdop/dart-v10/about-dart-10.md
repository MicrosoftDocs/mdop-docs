# About DaRT 10

DaRT 10 includes the following enhancements and changes.

## What’s new

- **Support for Windows 10**

    You can create DaRT images by using Windows 10.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For earlier versions of the Windows operating systems, continue to use the earlier versions of DaRT.

- **Windows Defender**

    Windows Defender is now part of the Windows 10 Preinstallation Environment (PE) image. As a result, Windows Defender has been removed from the DaRT 10 toolset.

## Requirements

- **Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit 10.0**

    [Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) 10.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install) is a required prerequisite for the DaRT Recovery Image Wizard. Windows ADK 10.0 contains deployment tools that are used to customize, deploy, and service Windows images. It also contains the Windows PE.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Windows ADK 10.0 is not required if you are installing only Remote Connection Viewer or Crash Analyzer.

- **Windows 10 Debugging Tools**

    To use the Crash Analyzer tool in DaRT 10, you need the required debugging tools, which are available in the Software Development Kit for Windows 10.
