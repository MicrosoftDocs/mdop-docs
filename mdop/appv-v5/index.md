# Application Virtualization 5

Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 5 lets administrators make applications available to end users without having to install the applications directly on end user computers. App-V transforms applications into centrally managed services that are never installed and don't conflict with other applications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> App-V end of support is April 14, 2026. For more information, see [Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP) support extended](/lifecycle/announcements/mdop-extended).
